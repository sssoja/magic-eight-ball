<h1>Magic Eight Ball</h1>
<p>You’ve learned a powerful tool in JavaScript: control flow! It’s so powerful, in fact, that it can be used to tell someone’s fortune.</p>

<p>In this project we will build the Magic Eight Ball using control flow in JavaScript.</p>

<p>The user will be able to input a question, then our program will output a random fortune.</p>
